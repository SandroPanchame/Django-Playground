9- Running and Debugging Tests in VSCode
    - ran into an issue where the testing window could not find the collections test
    - the course had the storefront directory as root, needed to make changes to settings.json
    - location: ./.vscode/settings.json
    - The setting was changed to:

        "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "./UltDjangoCourse/Part3/storefront3"
        ],
